### HW5-Dependency-Injection

The fifth homework for CT-406

**Dependency Injection** is a technique that allows for applications to be composed of loossly coupled modules. This basically means that 
services can be passed from one object to another without having to add extra data to the code. The example code does this for views, 
actions, and constructors.
This is a type of **Inversion of Control** (IoC) or a programming style that uses a specific framework to help control the flow of 
processes in the program. This can help fill views with simple information for view elements, such as populating a list, without having to 
hard code in the information.
**Explicit Dependencies Principle** is the idea that methods and classes should include any objects that are needed to complete their 
intended functions. It basically means that if a function needs information or actions from another class or function, they should  be 
pulled into the function that needs them rather than keeping them seperate. This can allow for more concise understanding of what a 
function needs to act properly, but can add length to the code.
